## How It Works

Form Genie uses a combination of web scraping and AI to fill out forms:

1. The extension scans the Google Form to identify questions and their types
2. It skips personal information fields to protect your privacy
3. For each question, it sends a request to OpenAI's API with context about the question and previous answers
4. The AI generates an appropriate response based on the question
5. The extension fills in the form field with the AI-generated response

## Supported Question Types

- Text fields
- Multiple choice questions (radio buttons)
- Checkboxes
- Dropdown menus

## Privacy

Form Genie:
- Does not collect or store any personal information
- Only sends form questions to OpenAI's API
- Does not track your browsing history
- Does not require any permissions beyond what's necessary to function

## Troubleshooting

- **Extension not working?** Make sure you're on a Google Form page and have set up your OpenAI API key.
- **API errors?** Check that your OpenAI API key is valid and has sufficient credits.
- **Form not being filled correctly?** Some complex forms may not be fully compatible. Try refreshing the page and trying again.
